Stollen Story:

There once was a German man who had a luftschloss. In it, he was the drummer of a popular rammstein. He dreamed of people singing
his music together in the Biergarten. Oftentimes he would get lost in his kopfkino. The only time he left it was when he went to the ratskeller. He worked hard at drumming, and was very wettbewerb-sfaehig. He even entered a drumming contest in Berlin to show off his musik. He wore a Dirndel to the contest.
As he walked down the Hauptstrasse towards the contest people laughed at him and his Dirndel.
